# BBoard

Not a bulletin board, it's a local kanban board for personal projects!

Currently still in progress, and has no local storage yet, but it has most other
features you would expect:

- A board
- Addable columns
- Renameable columns
- Tasks in those columns
    - You can drag tasks _between_ those columns (if you want)
    - You can even **delete** tasks
- A reasonably fancy stylesheet

## Expected Future Features

- Actually being able to save data to local storage
    - maybe a database
- More than 1 board
- Renaming boards
- Tags for tasks
- Images?
- At least a couple changeable styles
